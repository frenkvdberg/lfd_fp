### Retrieving all the necessary files and setting up
Before we can run the models, we first need to make sure that we have access to all the files by following these steps:
1. Download the trained lstm model as a .zip file from dropbox using this link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/cojnks0t2w15vbp/lstm_model.zip?dl=0
Then extract the zip file into the cache directory
2. DOWNLOAD BERT MODEL -- HIER LINK
3. Run the setup.sh shell script that will create a 'train' directory containing the COP files from 1 to 22, it also extracts the GloVe embeddings.
4. Install all dependencies by running $ pip install -r requirements.txt
